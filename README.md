🔭 I’m currently working on: renaming all "master", "slave", "whitelist", "blacklist" to more elegant names, so no one would get offended. <br/>
💬 Ask me: How I'm so productive? Gym everday at 5:00am, beging vegan and meditation helps a lot <br/>
🌱 I’m currently learning [C+=] to spread awareness of sexism
